    <p><strong>Favorite Animal:</strong> Cow</p>
    <p><strong>why?</strong>Beef, derived from cows, is one of the most widely consumed meats globally due to its rich flavor, high protein content, and cultural significance. From grilled steaks and slow-cooked stews to street-style delicacies like nyama choma, beef plays a central role in many culinary traditions. However, its consumption also raises important considerations around health, sustainability, and ethical farming practices, leading to growing interest in alternative proteins and responsible sourcing.</p>
